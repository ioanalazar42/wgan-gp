You can run all this locally (even if you don't have a GPU)!

# TEST THE CRITIC
"generated_images/" contains 20 images generated by various trained models.
1) 8x8 grids
2) images of single faces

The images in "generated_images/1x1" can be used to test the critic network.

Run this in the "Wasserstein-GAN-gradient-penalty" directory:
1) Score one random image in "generated_images/1x1/" using trained model "critic.pth".
    `python score_image.py`


# TEST THE GENERATOR
Run this in the "Wasserstein-GAN-gradient-penalty" directory:
1) Generate a grid of 64 images using trained model "generator.pth".
    `python generate_images.py`

2) Generate one image using trained model "generator.pth".
    `python generate_images.py --grid_size=1`


# HOW TO USE SCRIPTS
Run this:
    `./scripts/./test-WGAN-howto.sh`

Will show you how to use scripts. Below are the contents of the HOWTO script file:

        To SCORE an image: ./scripts/./score_images.sh <model_file_name> <image_path> <num_runs>
        Called by script <num_runs> times: python score_image.py --model_file_name=<model_file_name> --image_path=<image_path>

        To GENERATE images: ./scripts/./generate_images.sh <model_file_name> <grid_size> <num_runs>
        Called by script <num_runs> times: python generate_images.py --model_file_name=<model_file_name> --grid_size=<grid_size>

## Example commands with scripts.
1) Score one random image in "generated_images/1x1/" using trained model "critic.pth".
    `./scripts/./score_images.sh critic.pth random 1`

2) Score five random images in "generated_images/".
    `./scripts/./score_images.sh critic.pth random 5`

3) Generate one grid of 64 images using the trained model "generator.pth".
    `./scripts/./generate_images.sh generator.pth 64 1`

3) Generate 1 image using the trained model "generator.pth".
    `./scripts/./generate_images.sh generator.pth 1 1`
